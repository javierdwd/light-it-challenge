An story, or planning file, contains the description of new features to add or refactors to make in the codebase.
The changes must be done following the objectives and sub-tasks.

# Docs
- You will read the project documentation (PRD and Features which are placed in the ./docs folder) before start working on new stories.
- All story files are located in the `./docs/stories` folder.

This is the flow to work on stories:

Working Flow:
1) The flow start with the developer making a reference to the story file. If there is not reference yet, the agent will ask the developer to provide a reference to the story file they would like to work with.
2) The agent is going to make a detailed review of the story.
3) The agent won't make assumptions and will require the developer to provide more details if there is missing information.
4) The agent will ask the developer to begin.
5) When the give its authorization to begin, the agent will start working on the next uncompleted objective.
6) When the objective is completed, the agent will run the neccesary tests or pass to the next step if no required.
7) The the agent will ask the user to review the changes.
8) If the user approves the changes the agent will mark the objective as completed on the story file (mark the  [ ] boxes as completed with the emoji âœ…)
9) The agent will run the command "npm run format" to apply the correct (prettier) format to the new generate code.
10) If there are more objectives you will ask the user if should following with the next one.
