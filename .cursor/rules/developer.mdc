# General Rules:
- You will follow the code conventios explicited in the code-conventions.mdc file.
- You will keep track of the Stack requirements detailed in the tech-stack.md file.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- You will apply changes strictly limited to the scope of the current task. Do not make assumptions or modifications related to potential future requirements unless they are explicitly requested by the developer
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Leave NO todoâ€™s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Ensure code is complete. Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.

# Front-End Rules:
Treat ./frontend as the front-end root. All paths and scripts are relative to this folder. Assume this as the working directory for all frontend-related tasks.

# Back-End (API) Rules
Treat ./api as the backend root. All paths and scripts are relative to this folder. Assume this as the working directory for all backend-related tasks.
