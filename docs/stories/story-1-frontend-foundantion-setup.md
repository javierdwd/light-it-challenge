### [ ] Objective 6. Create Project Structure & Architecture
**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Set up folder structure for components, app (App Router), queries, types
- [ ] Implement Next.js 15 recommended patterns (Server Components, Client Components separation)
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for Patient data model
- [ ] Set up constants and configuration files
- [ ] Create utility functions structure
- [ ] Set up custom hooks directory
- [ ] Create layout components structure

### [ ] Objective 7. Configure Docker Environment
**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Create Dockerfile using node:22 base image
- [ ] Configure docker-compose.yml for frontend service
- [ ] Set up development and production build targets

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Technical Setup Requirements
1. **Next.js 15 with TypeScript** is properly installed and configured using App Router
2. **Latest Next.js patterns** are implemented (Server Components, Client Components, App Router)
3. **All specified libraries** from tech stack are installed with correct versions:
   - ESLint with Next.js, React, and React Hooks plugins
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Axios for HTTP client
   - TanStack Query for data fetching
   - React Hook Form for form management
   - Zod for validation schemas
   - Styled Components for styling

### ✅ Code Quality Standards
3. **ESLint configuration** catches TypeScript, React, and Next.js issues
4. **Prettier** formats code consistently across the project
5. **TypeScript compilation** passes without errors
6. **All linting rules** pass without warnings or errors

### ✅ Architecture & Structure
7. **Folder structure** is organized and follows Next.js App Router best practices:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/          # Reusable UI components
   ├── app/                # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
   ├── queries/            # TanStack Query hooks and API queries
   ├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
   ├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
   ├── styles/             # Global styles and theme
   ├── utils/              # Utility functions
   └── constants/          # Application constants
   ```
